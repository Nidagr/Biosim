class Landscape:
    """
    Landscape is the parent class for all types of landscape: Water, Highland, Lowland and Desert.
    An instance of a landscape subclass represents a single cell of the island that is to be
    simulated. Each landscape type has the parameter f_max, which represents the maximum amount of
    fodder growing in the cell. Each year the available amount of fodder in the cell regrows to
    f_max. Set it to 0 as a default value and give it a new value in the subclasses, where fodder
    grows. Initiate value available_fodder to be None, when instance of class is created. This
    variable includes the information of how much fodder is left after an animal has eaten. Will be
    updated by functions later on. Initiate empty lists for storing the carnivores and herbivores
    residing in this cell in the constructor.

    The cell will also include lists incoming_carnivores and incoming_herbivores which is of
    convenience when migrating animals in the BioSim class. They will be updated multiple times from
    there.
